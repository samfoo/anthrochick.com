    <h2>Approach</h2>

    <h4>Building trust by focusing on the client</h4>
    <p>
    By empathising with the stakeholders situation and keeping the informed of
    the direction we are taking. Understanding that new directors are often
    protective of their budding business so it's important to to keep them
    involved and any work should be phased in the 'we' tense to help encourage
    feelings of collaboration and transperency. It's very important for our
    client that we are making their job easier so we need to make sure our
    research is through and they trust us with the information they are
    providing.
    </p>

    <h4>Methods</h4>
    <p>
    In this scenario I relied heavily on sketching materials and user flows. I
    spoke to my client daily about the strategy and the steps I was taking to
    impliment a solution. I decided to design for a mobile device. I performed
    user testing. In the final stages and I created an interactive POP
    application.

        In client interview it was revealed that the client rarely carries anything
        other than their phone.  Our solution was to create a mobile app for internal
        order traking, while also offering the client a way to  show examples of
        existing work as they discusses B&C's products.
