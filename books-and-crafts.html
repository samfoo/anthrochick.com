    <p>
    Books &amp; Crafts creates personalised stationary. They're a small
    business who are transitioning to something bigger. As the business
    continues to grow they face greater difficulties tracking orders and
    managing clients.
    </p>

    <p>
    Books &amp; Crafts wanted to improve their order managment, but the owner
    is always on the road. They asked me to rapidly prototype a mobile
    application to solve their problem.

    <h2>Iterating and interviewing quickly</h2>
    <p>
    Because one week is such a short time, I relied on an extremely light
    weight approach. I created an interactive prototype that could be
    quickly changed and tested with the user.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subsection">Understanding the dilemma</h3>

    <p>
    I spent time interviewing the client to understand how she currently takes
    an order. From this, I broke the workflow down into three stages
    and illustrated them.

    <h3 class="subsection">Modeling the business user flow</h3>

    <p>
    In the interview with the business owner, it was revealed that she rarely
    carries anything other than her phone. The solution was obvious: create a
    mobile app to track orders. This could also offer her a way to show
    examples of existing work and upsell.
