    <p>
    Cochlear Medical Devices specialises in hearing devices for the profoundly
    deaf. Cochlear wanted to understand why their first new software update in
    30 years was unsuccessful.
    </p>

    <p>
    Cochlear CTLD had released a program to make fitting Cochlear devices
    easier, however, audiologists had rejected the software. Cochlear wanted to
    understand why their first program update in 30 years was globally
    unsuccessful and what they needed  to do for their next iteration.
    </p>

    <p>
    This case study focuses on the roll out of a global research program and
    the advantages of qualitative research.

    <h2>Discovery</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
        Stakeholder interviews to learn the key assumptions Cochlear
        stakeholders and regional managers had about their audiologists.
        </li>

        <li>
        Learning sessions to understand the two primary and highly technical
        cochlear fitting technology, Custom Sound and NFS, the advantages and
        disadvantages when making unique hear profiles for clients, and gain
        familiarity with the device types and why different ones are used.
        </li>

        <li>
        Identification of key geographical areas of research; Australia,
        Singapore, Vietnam, Germany, America and South America.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dependencies</h2>

    <p>
    This required remote interview training of Cochlear agents in the Americas
    and remote interviews with German audiologists. Followed by contextual
    research in the South Pacific region.
    </p>

    <h2>Synthesis</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
        Field work was transcribed and various Cochlear teams from the learning
        centre, marketing, legal, interface design, technical development,
        faults, analysis and scientists were brought in to assist unpacking of
        the data and the synthesis process. This also served to keep the
        process transparent and stakeholders engaged. A thematic coding program
        was used to assist with quantifying the data and to remove bias from
        the findings.
        </li>

        <li>
        Additional quantitative studies were also run to supplement  the data.
        </li>

        <li>
        Unpacking audiologist mindsets internationally to create personas and
        understand their motivations, ambitions and desires.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Develop</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
        While the German audiologists confirmed many of Cochlear's assumptions
        on audiologist behaviour, Indonesia and Vietnam completely bucked the
        trends. This insight into the conflicting approaches and attitudes
        meant that Cochlear had to reconsider what "experience" meant, and
        further adjust their software strategy.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stakeholder Management</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
        Frequent playback and insight playback as they surfaced.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prototyping</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
        Design jams and ideation sessions.
        </li>

        <li>
        To develop concepts to address challenges raised by the research; these
        were tested remotely and at Cochlear headquarters.
        </li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <h2>Deliver</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
        Cochlear was able to understand why NFS was unsuccessful and what they
        needed to do going forward to ensure they met the needs of their
        audiologists
        </li>

        <li>
        Delivery of insights library and research report.
        </li>

        <li>
            Key findings included:
            <ul>
                <li>
                The software, NFS, was perceived as offensive and patronising
                by the majority of Western Audiologists and especially by the
                key influences.
                </li>

                <li>
                Cochlear had failed to convince the audiologist community of
                the benefits of NFS.
                </li>

                <li>
                Western audiologists considered themselves infallibly to have
                more experience and more knowledge than their eastern
                counterparts. This belief was also held by the eastern
                participants. However, examination revealed that eastern
                audiologists fit significantly more devices per week and year
                than their western counterparts, and by number of clients alone
                a Vietnamese audiologist would fit more cochlear devices in a
                year than most western audiologists would in their careers.
                </li>

                <li>
                Further, in the west, new cochlear clients tend to be older as
                people loose their hearing. In Asia, a growing population of
                children are the ones who are fitted, which changed the
                marketing approach.

        </li>
