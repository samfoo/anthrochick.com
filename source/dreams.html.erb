        <h2>Parrot Sanctuary</h2>
        <p>
            I used to work with parrot rehabilitation. I aim to get back into
            it once I can secure a large avery. Parrots are wonderful creatures
            and people often want to keep them as pets. As parrots live for
            around 100 years, parrots often outlive their owners. In these
            cases, birds are typically abandoned. I want to create an avery
            charity to house abandoned birds.
