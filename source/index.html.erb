    <h2>What is anthropology &amp; how why is it important for UX?</h2>

    <p>
    Anthropology is a discipline that seeks knowledge of human behaviour and
    everything humans are involved with. UX deals with the experiences that a
    person has with a product or a service.
    </p>

    <p>
    Anthropology focuses on research and observation. It involves being
    immersed in the experiences of others, what their motivations are, and
    which belief systems they ascribe to. UX is a process of designing to the
    cultural conditioning that a given human ascribes to. Together, UX and
    anthropology, are powerful tools that allow you to understand why someone
    does what they do and how to optimise for those behaviours.
