    <p>
    Namegear is a domain name registration service, targetting the
    English-speaking Asia-Pacific market. They aim to redefine the industry by
    offering innovative products that are secure and intuitive.
    </p>

    <p>
    Namegear wanted to improve conversions on their website in two key areas:
    The registration of new domains and the transfer of existing domains.

    <h2>Researching</h2>
    <p>
    We crafted a survey to help identify how existing customers associate
    "trust" with domain registrars, and conducted interviews with
    friends/family to get a feel for general knowledge in the market. We also
    checked out other domain registration websites that Namegear recognised as
    close competitors. This way we were able to gather a surprising amount of
    understanding in a short period of time.

    <p>
    Our interviews followed a conversation guide that we developed to assess
    participants domain knowledge, their motivations, and where they drop out
    in the conversion funnel. This allowed us to form a customer journey map.

    <h2>Developing personas</h2>
    <p>
    We created three personas that were based on the interviews with fifteen
    participants and the survey. We styled the personas after Pokémon &mdash; a
    playful reminder of the culture of the Japanese company.

    <h2>Designing for two levels of experience</h2>

    <p>
    We found that there were two key customer segments: one with a strong
    technical background and one with a basic technical background. We used
    this to model different flows for each, then tested it against real users.

    <h2>Redesigning with mockups</h2>

    <p>
    To rapidly test with real-user feedback, we started putting together some
    light weight wireframes of what a new design might look like. The two user
    flows gave us a foundation on which to drive out the design.
